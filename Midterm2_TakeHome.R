# Consider building a sequence of numbers starting with a positive integer n. If the term is even, 
# then the next term is one half of that previous term. If the previous term is odd, then the next term 
# is 3 times the previous term plus 1.  Continue building the sequence following this pattern and end the 
# sequence when you reach one.
